    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley. I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics and my Master's of Science in Applied Mathematics with a specialization in Probability and Statistics under the supervision of Professor Anthony C. Davison. I had the chance to be a visiting scholar in Berkeley where I worked on survival analysis applied to avalanche data under the supervision of Professor Nicholas P. Jewell.

      I am now very fortunate to be advised by Professor Peng Ding. The focus of my thesis is on causal inference and more specifically on the analysis of complex two-stage experiments without making model-based assumptions. I am also interested in Machine Learning and Survival Analysis.
